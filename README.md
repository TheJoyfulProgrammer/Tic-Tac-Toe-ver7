# Tic-Tac-Toe-ver7
A highly optimized Tic Tac Toe game, written in C++ ver17, with tons of features. It works in Linux and Windows.

This game can be compiled with the GCC compiler toolchain, ver 9.3, in Linux, and with the TDM-GCC compiler toolchain, ver 9.0, in Windows. It will not compile with the MingW compiler toolchain when you use the "std::this_thread" function.

The source code provides tons of powerful features that works in Linux and Windows, like:

*  SetCtInterfaceColors(ForegroundColor, BackgroundColor)
*  Color(ForegroundColor)
*  Color(ForegroundColor, BackgroundColor)
*  ClearScreen()
*  SetCursor(XCoord, YCoord)
*  SetCtInterfaceTitle(Title)

The CheckStatus() function in the game engine, checks if there any wins, ties, or if the game should still play, and it does that with only two lines of code, including the return statement.

This Tic Tac Toe Engine is nothing like you have ever seen before.
